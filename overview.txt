# IMAGE PROCESSING ENGINE - IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

## COMPONENTS STATUS [✓=complete, ⚠=partial, ✗=todo]
✓ Extractor: Handles ZIP/TAR archives and HuggingFace datasets
✓ Renamer: Implements bidXXXXXX naming convention
✓ Analyzer: Collects image metadata and statistics
✓ Filter: Removes images below 800px threshold
✓ Converter: Transforms images to WebP with quality preservation
✓ Packager: Creates ZIP archives with processed images
✓ BatchProcessor: Orchestrates complete processing pipeline
✓ DatabaseManager: Tracks all images and processing status
✓ ProgressManager: Displays CLI progress and statistics
✓ NetworkManager: Handles robust network operations with retry logic
✓ MemoryOptimizer: Manages memory usage for large batches

## DATA FLOW
Source → Extract → Rename → Analyze → Filter → Convert → Package → Output
- Input: ZIP/TAR archives, HuggingFace datasets, image directories
- Output: WebP images in ZIP archive + JSON reports + DB entries

## CONFIG DEFAULTS
